        A global oilfield equipment provider needed a faster, automated
        process for inside salespeople to submit quotes and wanted to
        introduce a customer facing, self-service portal as well. The client
        needed to collect all their product related data in one place to
        ensure consistent quoting.
      approachheader: Approach
      approachtext:
        North Highland started the engagement with a series of Futures
        workshops to establish a digital vision. The immediate need
        identified was an e-Commerce platform to speed up the sales cycle
        and enable self-service for their customers.
        It was clear that this would have monumental impact on the business
        this was not just about establishing a digital sales channel, this
        was about transforming an entire organization to become digitally
        enabled.
        Leveraging our service design framework, we developed a current and
        future state service architecture in co-creation with stakeholders
        to visualize the changes needed. It helped all stakeholders to
        connect the dots and highlight high-value areas of focus.
        To get buy-in from across the organization, we ran a parallel track
        addressing the service architecture (logistics, fullfillment,
        Salesforce integration) needed and creating a proof of concept for
        the customer-facing e-Commerce platform in form of a prototype. The
        prototype made the vision come to life and gave stakeholders the
        opportunity to react and provide feedback. It shifted the client's
        mindset from the anxiety of not knowing to anticipating the changes
        with excitement. As the service architecture matured the prototype
        evolved.
      resultheader: Result
      resulttext:
        North Highland used its software development lifecycle to deliver a
        self-service portal, providing a unique experience for both
        employees and customer to submit quotes to Salesforce. Portal users
        can now create over 5,000 different product configurations,
        visualize final product assembly, and customize shipments.
        Salespeople can also apply discounts and view commissions per quote.
        A CMS populated with product data for over 3,000 unique products
        serves as single source of truth for all product related activities.

        North Highland assembled a multi-disciplinary Pod of UI and UX

        America's team. The North Highland team integrated seamlessly with
        the client's Marketing function, quickly getting up to speed and
        delivering high-quality output. The team also proactively seeked
        opportunities to improve current workflows and share best practices
        with the client to improve overall delivery performance.

      resulttext: North Highland established an order intake process to provide

        and the new KPIs provided visibility into creative development. The
        new service model enhanced the structure of the field marketing

        resulting in over $100k in savings.

        The client is a global leader in 3D printing technology that is

        education. Yet their website was that of an industrial printer maker
        from ten years ago. They wanted to take a great leap, transforming
        their digital experience to that of a brand leader, while creating a
        significantly better tool for selling what their customers want – 3D
        solutions, not a lineup of printers.

      approachtext: North Highland partnered with the client’s Digital team to
        re-platform, reinvent, redesign and relaunch their website in only
        three months. Our multidisciplinary team conducted a competitive
        analysis, customer interviews, content audits, and SEO analysis to
        inform user experience, design and content recommendations. Agile
        processes and principles were used throughout. The new site
        reinforces the client’s market authority, differentiates them from
        existing and emerging competitors, and enhances the platform as a
        lead generation tool.
