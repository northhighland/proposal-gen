  description: We spend each day advising our clients to question the ways they
    work – from creating entirely new business models to transforming their
    organizational structures. Yet the management consulting industry is marked
    by inflated pricing structures of large consulting firms, designed to
    support big business and big corporate budgets. North Highland brings a
    pricing strategy and approach that is transparent, custom, and designed to
    generate sustainable growth and significant value for lasting change.
